Demo project using GraphQL with clean JS - connection

To get data you need to make get data with specific query
Every network request should be done by using async/await method. After response you will either get list of data or empty list or error. 

Later we should implement async/await with try and catch to catch issues from client side. 
If we get error user should be seen error either as unkown or network error. We should implement use cases for such error
